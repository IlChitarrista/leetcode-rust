# Leetcode Rust Exercises
This will be a way to keep track of my progress with the Rust Programming Language and Programming in General.
## Compiling
In order to run any of the exercises you will need to locate yourself inside the exercise's directory
#### Example
    cd exercises/1_two_sums
You can then use the Cargo Package Manager to Compile and Run the single exercises using both the `cargo run` and `cargo run --release` to get an Optimized Binary; Cargo will automatically fetch all the required dependencies.
## Scope
As specified in the heading this will be a way for me to keep track of my progress and it probably won't feature the best solution to the given problem but it will feature a logical explanation of each solution I implement.  Because this is only intended to be a way for me to track my learning I probably won't accept any merge requests with improvements as I want this to be an unbiased view of my Programming Journey.
However Issues with suggestions are greatly appreciated because Learning and Improving is my objective.
